 Treating Venous Disease (VD) with Expert Care: Vascular Health in New Jersey

Introduction:

Venous Disease (VD) is a common condition that affects millions of people, causing discomfort and potential complications. It occurs when the veins in the legs, arms, or other parts of the body fail to efficiently return blood to the heart, leading to pooling and swelling. Vascular Health, a trusted healthcare provider in New Jersey, specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of venous disease. In this article, we will explore the causes, symptoms, and the comprehensive range of effective treatments provided by Vascular Health to help patients find relief and improve their venous health.

Understanding Venous Disease (VD):
Venous Disease refers to a group of conditions that affect the veins, impairing their ability to transport blood back to the heart effectively. This can lead to a variety of venous disorders, including varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and spider veins. VD can manifest with discomfort, pain, and visible changes on the skin's surface, impacting a person's quality of life and overall well-being.

Symptoms and Risk Factors:
Recognizing the symptoms and risk factors associated with Venous Disease is crucial for early detection and appropriate treatment. Common symptoms of VD include:

Swelling in the legs or ankles
Aching, heaviness, or cramping in the legs
Visible varicose veins or spider veins
Skin discoloration or changes in texture
Itching or burning sensation around the affected veins
Several factors can contribute to the development of Venous Disease, such as:

Family history of venous conditions
Prolonged periods of standing or sitting
Obesity and lack of physical activity
Pregnancy
Smoking
Previous history of blood clots

Some of the specialized Venous Disease treatments provided by Vascular Health include:

a. Sclerotherapy:

Sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat spider veins and small varicose veins. A solution is injected directly into the affected veins, causing them to collapse and eventually fade away, improving both the appearance and symptoms.

b. Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA):

EVLA is a modern and effective treatment for larger varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. The procedure involves using laser energy to seal the problematic vein, rerouting blood flow to healthier veins, and providing relief from pain and swelling.

c. Venaseal Closure System:

The Venaseal Closure System is a cutting-edge treatment that utilizes medical adhesive to seal off diseased veins. It eliminates the need for multiple needle sticks, providing patients with a more comfortable and efficient treatment experience.

d. Ambulatory Phlebectomy:

For certain cases of varicose veins, ambulatory phlebectomy may be recommended. This minimally invasive procedure involves the removal of superficial varicose veins through tiny incisions, leaving little to no scarring.
